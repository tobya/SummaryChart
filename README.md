Turn Google Form Spreadsheet value into a Summary Chart

[Google Forms]() are great, they give you a really simple way to capture information and feedback from customers or friends. When your done you can get a really nice summary of your reponses.

The old V1 version of forms provided a long list of charts with information on each option in the chart, this was good for printing out and sharing with people.  The V2 no longer does this, with the charts being shown on a single frame in the page and it is not possible to print out. 

This project allows you to create these really simple charts all over again.  PHP and Javascript you can download it then input the GoogleDocID used for sharing the responses spreadsheet.  Any Multiselect option on your form will be turned into a set of charts.
